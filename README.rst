KGNSEval: Knowledge Grpah Negative Sampling Evaluation.

KGNSEval is a compehensive negative sampling evaluation for knowledge graph (KG) embedding relying solely on Pytorch. This 
evaluation provides insights to researchers in undestanding influsing factors in negative sampling. This Evaluation is carried 
out on top of the [TorchKGE] framework.
